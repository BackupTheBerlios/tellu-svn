Please read this guide carefully and go through each step.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. BUILDING THE SERVERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 These prerequisities are mandatory:

  * MySQL client library and header files,
  * OpenLDAP libraries and header files,

 and following are optional, you need them only if you want to build telmon
 (the graphical tellu server monitoring tool):

  * Motif libraries and header files,
  * X Window System libraries and header files.

 Once you have all required libraries and headers reachable, you can build all
 server programs and telmon at once with following script seen below, here you
 need to tune paths to suit your environment:

 for i in telinfo tellud telmon telmond telskind; do
	(cd $i && ./configure \
		--prefix=/usr/local \
		--with-mysql=/opt/mysql \
		--with-openldap=/opt/openldap \
		--with-motif=/opt/motif \
		--with-x11=/usr/X11R6 && \
		make clean && make && make install ) || exit 1 ;
 done

 If you don't want to use script above, remember that it is VERY important to
 run `make clean' before `make' and `make install', because there is some
 common source files shared between servers in `common' directory, and if
 some common file compiled for one server is linked to another it may cause
 fatal conflicts. So please always remember `make clean' before `make'.

 After succesful build, you can copy common/tellu.init.d file to /etc/init.d/
 directory and use that for controlling the servers. tellu.init.d script obeys
 normal init-script style parameters, like start, stop, restart and status,
 whose behaviour should be self explainable.

 If build fails because of missing dependencies (even when configure script
 succeeded), you need to tailor Makefile by hand. Makefiles are very simple
 (less than 40 lines), so editing them should not be too painful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2. CONFIGURING THE SERVERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before starting tellu servers you need to check configuration files, they are
 located at PREFIX/etc. Prefix is the place which you chose when you installed
 the servers. For now it is wise to go with default settings, except MySQL
 parameters, which may be necessary to change. So, open `tellud.conf',
 `telmond.conf' and `telskind.conf' and look for `mysql_' parameters from
 bottom of each file and change them to suit your environment. Leave
 `mysql_database', `mysql_username' and `mysql_password' as they are for now.
 You can also set `ldap_' parameters in `telskind.conf' at this point, if you
 want to use LDAP authentication in Tellu Skin. More of setting up Skin later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3. THE DATABASE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Now initialize tellu database by issuing command ($ denotes shell prompt, so
 don't type it):

  $ mysql -h MYSQLHOST -u root -p < tellu_db.sql

 and ofcourse replace MYSQLHOST with your MySQL host name, and if you like to
 use some other user for initializing than root, replace user also. If your
 user does not have a password, you can remove the `-p' switch.

 If some reason you need to reinitialize the database, you need to drop tellu
 database first before running `mysql' statement again. If you don't, you get
 all data duplicated in database because `tellu_db.sql' does not remove
 possibly already existing data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4. STARTING THE SERVERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To fire up the servers, use `tellu.init.d' script which you hopefully copied
 to /etc/init.d or whichever is the place in your environment for init scripts.

  $ /etc/init.d/tellu.init.d start

 should start all three servers, `tellud', `telmond' and `telskind'. If all
 went ok, you can proceed to installing Tellu Skin. In case of troubles, please
 consult the syslog.
