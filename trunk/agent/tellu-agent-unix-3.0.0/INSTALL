Please read this guide carefully and go through each step.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. BUILDING THE AGENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 These prerequisities are mandatory:

  * DBus library and header files (version 1.0 or greater),
  * Hal library and header files (version 0.5 or greater).

 Once you have all required libraries and headers reachable, you can build the
 agent with following commands seen below, here you need to tune paths to suit
 your environment ($ denotes shell prompt, so don't type it):

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-dbus=/opt/dbus --with-hal=/opt/hal
  $ make clean
  $ make
  $ make install

 If build fails because of missing dependencies (even when configure script
 succeeded), you need to tailor Makefile by hand. Makefile is very simple
 (less than 40 lines), so editing it should not be too painful. For example,
 if you are on Solaris, you may need to define some additional libraries
 `-lsocket -lnsl', in line 16 where all other libraries are defined.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2. CONFIGURING THE AGENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before starting tellu agent you need to check the configuration file, it is
 located in PREFIX/etc. Prefix is the place which you chose when you installed
 the agent. Parameters which needs modification are at least `tellud_server',
 `tellud_port' and possibly `domain_override'. Do not touch other parameters
 yet. Set `tellud_server' parameter to server name where tellud is running, and
 `tellud_port' to the port which tellud listens (by default this is 1700). If
 agent is unable to resolve the domain name, you need to set `domain_override'
 parameter as well. So check the domain name, for example:

  $ domainname

 and if command above does not return anything related to domain name, hardcode
 domain in agent's configuration. Otherwise you can comment out the whole
 `domain_override' parameter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3. STARTING THE AGENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Now you can start the agent:

  $ cd PREFIX/bin
  $ ./tellu

 which collects machine data and sends them to tellud which stores collected
 data in database. Please check the server's syslog, there should be note about
 agent's connection, as well the database is populated with collected machine
 data.
