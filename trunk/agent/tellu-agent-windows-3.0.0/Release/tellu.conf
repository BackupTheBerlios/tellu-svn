# Tellu client default configuration.
#
# Tellu client will use this file as a default configuration if neither
# 'UserName.conf', 'userid.conf', 'userid@DOMAINNAME.conf', 'HOSTNAME.conf',
# 'HOSTNAME.DOMAINNAME.conf' nor 'DOMAINNAME.conf' was found. If you want to use
# per-user, per-host or per-domain basis configurations, copy this file as
# described in examples above.
#
# Tellu client looks configuration files either in the current directory or in
# the directory which was given as a parameter from the commandline or in a
# desktop shortcut in Windows. In the Windows' commandline or its desktop
# shortcut both UNC and driveletter path formats are supported.
#
# If you modify this file on some other OS than Windows, please remember the
# linefeed, it should be Windows style CRLF. All configuration files must be
# saved in ASCII format. Therefore, you should not edit this file in Word, Works
# or in any 'real' word processor. On Windows, Notepad is always a safe choice
# for editing plain ASCII files. If you don't understand what ASCII, linefeed or
# Notepad is, please ask your technical support for assistance _before_
# modifying this file.
#
# All keywords are case sensitive, and must be written in lowercase. Generally
# positive parameter must be presented as 1, and negative parameter as 0 unless
# stated otherwise.
#
# Please do not change _anything_ what does not ring a bell.

# Parameter cannot be longer than 1024 characters.

#
# Port which tellud server listens. If you are behind a firewall and it blocks
# port specified below, you need to tune either your firewall or this port to

# must not be reserved already in some other purpose.
# Range is: from 1 to 65535.

# Override the real domain name in which this workstation belongs to. This can
# be useful if you want to isolate every subnet as a different domain for
# example, even when subnets belongs to same physical domain. This improves
# useability and readability in Tellu skin if one domain contains a huge amount
# of workstations. Comment out to use real domain name.
# Note: if client is unable to detect real domain name, you need to set it here.
# Parameter cannot be longer than 1024 characters.
#

# Password, or Tellu magick cookie, for authenticating with the server.

# ACL's for this file in way that no network users are able to open it.
# Parameter cannot be longer than 30 characters.
